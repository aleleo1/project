# Data Visualization Platform

This project is a modern web application for interactive visualization of time series data, designed for scientific and industrial use cases such as environmental monitoring and volcanic eruption analysis.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), providing a fast, reactive UI.
- **Visualization:** Uses the custom [`widv-plot`](pkg-prototype/) package for interactive charts (zoom, pan, date selection).
- **Backend:** Node.js server with MySQL integration for data storage and retrieval.
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS for rapid UI development.

## Features

- Interactive time series visualization (zoom, pan, date selection)
- Export current view as standalone HTML
- State management via URL for easy sharing and reproducibility
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Advanced filtering and scenario comparison

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
